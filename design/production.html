        <h1>The Daily Californian</h1>
        <p>The Daily Californian is an independent, student-run newspaper covering both the UC Berkeley campus and the city of Berkeley. During my time at the Daily Cal, I've notably served as the Night Editor in spring 2022 and the Production Director in summer 2022, where I oversaw the nightly production of the newspaper in both online and print. As Production Director, I was in charge of overseeing all business-related content creation, including advertising, fundraising, readership and business campaigns. </p>

        <h2>Media Kit</h2>
        <p>I led the design of the Daily Cal’s 2022-23 media kit, which contains all logistical information regarding print and digital advertising with the Daily Cal. The media kit is distributed to potential clients nationwide by the Sales department and serves as an important tool in driving the newspaper’s revenue.</p>

        <h2>Hiring Materials</h2>
        <p>I designed hiring materials for the Daily Cal's managers, editors and staffers to spread the word about this Daily Cal and encourage new students to join. This included flyer designs to hand out to students on campus and social media materials (including Instagram posts, Instagram stories, Facebook cover photos and Twitter cover photos) for staffers to spread awareness online.</p>

        <p>I also worked in the design department at The Daily Californian to produce layouts for the weekly print publication. From sports feature spreads to impactful and creative news layouts, I have designed multiple editions of the newspaper throughout my time working for this publication.</p>
