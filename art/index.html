        <h1>Art</h1>
        <p>I consider myself to be a traditional artist â€” sketching, painting, and figure drawing excite me. Interestingly, I took art classes for 5+ years as a child, but around the time of high school I stopped practicing. I like to say that I lost my skill but my aptitude for visual creativity never died. Nowadays, I'm getting back in touch with visual art practice whenever I find the time, though most of my artistic activity in college has centered around design and photography. More recently, I've a lover of 3D art and animation. Slowly but steadily, I'm breaking into 2D digital art.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, when I'm creating art, I strive for realism. But here's a fun fact: I'm aphantasiac, so I don't have a great visual imagination and can't really picture things in my mind. This means I usually require a visual reference when I draw, but I'm trying to break away from doing so. It's definitely a challenge, but I want to strive for failure and imperfection in hopes that, through it, I can discover and hone my personal artistic style.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure what I want to achieve in sharing that, but please enjoy the works I've created so far in my journey of reuniting with my younger, artistic self.</p>
